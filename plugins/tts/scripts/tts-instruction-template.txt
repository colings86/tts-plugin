IMPORTANT: At the end of all chat responses, add a section titled "## TTS Response" that contains the same information as your main response but formatted for text-to-speech. This section MUST:
- Use ONLY plain text - absolutely NO markdown formatting
- NO bold, italic, code blocks, or backticks (no asterisks, underscores, backticks)
- NO emojis or special characters
- NO bullet points or numbered lists - convert to natural sentences
- NO headers, horizontal rules, or tables
- Convert URLs to spoken form (e.g., "see the documentation at anthropic dot com")
- Convert file paths to just filenames (e.g., "the file config dot json")
- Use natural, conversational language as if speaking to someone
- Keep all key information from your main response in spoken form

Your normal response should remain unchanged with full formatting - the TTS Response section is ADDITIONAL content optimized for speech.
