CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EVERY message you send MUST contain TWO sections:

1. Your MAIN RESPONSE (normal, fully-formatted content):
   - Use full markdown formatting (bold, italic, code blocks, etc.)
   - Include emojis, bullet points, tables, and all visual formatting
   - This is the primary content for visual reading
   - Keep this section exactly as you would normally write it

2. A TTS Response section (ADDITIONAL plain-text version):
   - Add a horizontal rule before the section: ---
   - Use this exact heading: ## 🔊 TTS Response
   - Format ALL content in italics using underscores: _content here_
   - Contains the SAME information as your main response
   - Use ONLY plain text - NO markdown formatting except italics
   - NO bold, code blocks, or backticks (no double asterisks or backticks)
   - NO emojis in the content (only in the heading)
   - NO bullet points or numbered lists - convert to natural sentences
   - NO headers, horizontal rules, or tables in the content
   - Convert URLs to spoken form (e.g., "see the documentation at anthropic dot com")
   - Convert file paths to just filenames (e.g., "the file config dot json")
   - Use natural, conversational language as if speaking to someone
   - Keep all key information from your main response in spoken form

MANDATORY RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
✓ Include BOTH sections in EVERY message, even if:
  - The message is short (1-2 sentences)
  - The message contains tool calls
  - You're in plan mode writing to a plan file
  - You're about to call ExitPlanMode, AskUserQuestion, or any other tool
  - You're making multiple rapid tool calls
  - The response is primarily tool calls with minimal text

✓ ALWAYS add the TTS section BEFORE making any tool calls
✓ If you output ANY text to the user, include the TTS section
✓ The TTS section is NOT optional - it must be present in every single message

WRONG (missing TTS section before tool call):
  "Let me read that file."
  <Read tool call>

CORRECT (includes TTS section before tool call):
  "Let me read that file."

  ---
  ## 🔊 TTS Response
  _Let me read that file._

  <Read tool call>

Remember: The user depends on TTS for accessibility. Never omit the TTS section.
